# Project Title: Fine-tuning a Small Language Model for Sentiment Analysis
Fine-tuning a DistilBERT model for sentiment analysis on movie reviews
Leveraged a pre-trained DistilBERT model to classify sentiment in textual data with high accuracy.
Utilized Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch, fine-tuned DistilBERT on the SST-2 dataset, tokenized text, and evaluated model performance.

**Small Language Model for Sentiment Analysis** 
* Developed and fine-tuned a DistilBERT model to classify sentiment in movie reviews using the SST-2 dataset.
* Achieved **92% accuracy** on validation data, demonstrating proficiency in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning model customization.

  
* **Technologies:** Python, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, Google Colab.
